# MSC-ADAMS-IF-function

To control the motion of one or multiple objects in MSC ADAMS software, it gets pretty tricky and tedious because there is no direct way to create this type of curve.

Given the coordinates of the curve that you want to define the motion or Force to travel along, and the value, the code generates the IF command in ADAMS. This code will achieve the motion exactly as prescribed if the number of steps is high enough.
